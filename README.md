# Loan Repayment Risk Prediction

This project is a Streamlit web application that predicts the risk of a customer defaulting on a loan. It uses a pre-trained machine learning model to make predictions based on customer data.

## üöÄ Live Demo

## Model Architecture

The prediction model is a machine learning pipeline that consists of the following steps:

1.  **Data Preprocessing**:
      * Categorical features are encoded using label encoders.
      * Numerical features are scaled using a standard scaler.
2.  **Dimensionality Reduction**:
      * Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the number of features.
3.  **Prediction**:
      * A pre-trained classification model is used to predict the probability of loan default and classify the result as "Approved" or "Rejected".
